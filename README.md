| 01 | Band Name Generator | Strings, Variables, Input Function |
| 02 | Tip Calculator | Data Types, Mathematical Operations, F-Strings |
| 03 | Treasure Island | Control Flow, Logical Operators, Nested If/Else |
| 04 | Rock Paper Scissors | Randomisation, Python Lists, Indexing |
| 05 | Password Generator | For Loops, range() function, List Manipulation |
| 06 | Escaping the Maze | Functions, While Loops, Logic Flow, Debugging |

## 🚀 Goals
- Master Python fundamentals and complex logic.
- Build real-world AI and Automation projects (like my **RATS** project).
- Develop a strong portfolio of 100 projects to showcase my coding journey.
- Transition into AI-driven development.
